## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
cd /Users/krishnapandey/Desktop/XYZ
flutter pub get
```

### Step 2: Deploy Firestore Configuration
```bash
# Make sure you're logged into Firebase
firebase login

# Deploy indexes and rules
./scripts/deploy_firestore_config.sh
```

### Step 3: Build and Test
```bash
# Run tests to ensure everything works
flutter test

# Build release version
flutter build apk --release
# or for iOS
flutter build ios --release
```

### Step 4: Monitor Performance
- Enable Firebase Performance Monitoring in console
- Set up alerts for response times > 2s
- Monitor cache hit rates (target: >80%)
- Track Firebase usage and costs
